# messageBoxes
A small js library that you can include in your project to get easy access to modern looking, strongly customizable message boxes that have a lot of functionality.

You can take a look at [the demo page](https://tobias-auer.github.io/messageBoxLib/) and look at the [corresponding code](https://github.com/Tobias-Auer/messageBoxLib/blob/main/index.html) and try to figure it out yourself how to use this library.

Or, maybe, just maybe, take a quick look at the [documentation](https://github.com/Tobias-Auer/messageBoxLib/blob/main/documentation/documentation.md). ðŸ‘€  
I promise, it isn't that bad.  
 

To embed the files into your project you could download them or use the following links:  
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Tobias-Auer/messageBoxLib/style.css" />

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Tobias-Auer/messageBoxLib/messageBoxes.js" defer></script>
```  

Or use the shortend links (may take longer to load):  
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://bit.ly/MsgCSS" />

<script src="https://bit.ly/MsgJS" defer></script>
```
