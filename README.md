You can take a look at [the demo page](https://tobias-auer.github.io/messageBoxLib/) and look at the [corresponding code](https://github.com/Tobias-Auer/messageBoxLib/blob/main/index.html) and try to figure it out yourself how to use this library.

Or, maybe, just maybe, take a quick look at the [documentation](https://github.com/Tobias-Auer/messageBoxLib/blob/main/documentation/documentation.md). ðŸ‘€  
I promise, it isn't that bad.
